# If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.
#
# Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as npm
# start, npm stop, npm restart, npm test, and npm run-script will still run
# their intended script if ignore-scripts is set, but they will not run any pre-
# or post-scripts.
