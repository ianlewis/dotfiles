Vim Files
----------------

This folder ends up being linked to the ~/.vim and contains various vim
settings.

Files like \_vimrc end up being linked to .vimrc and the like.

vim plugins are linked as git submodules in the bundle directory and loaded in
vim using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).  See the \_vimrc
file at the top for where pathogen is loaded.
