# Bash settings

This directory contains bash specific scripts. Various scripts for different
purposes are broken into separate files, such as `.bash_aliases` and
`.bash_completion`.

Machine local files can be created by suffixing .local to the file name and
putting it in your home directory. For example, .bashrc will load a script
called .bashrc.local if it exists. This goes for other scripts like
`.bash_aliases`, `.bash_completion`, etc.

`.inputrc` contains shell key mappings.
