# Bash settings

This directory contains bash specific scripts. Machine local files can be
created by suffixing .local to the file name and putting it in your home
directory. For example, .bashrc will load a script called .bashrc.local if it
exists. This goes for other scripts like `.bash_aliases`, `.bash_completion`,
etc.
