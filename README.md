# Ian's dotfiles

[![](https://travis-ci.org/ianlewis/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ianlewis/dotfiles)

These dotfiles are based on [Armin Ronacher's dotfiles](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/dotfiles)
where the many ideas were copied shamelessly.

# Install

Dotfiles are installed using a simple Makefile in the root directory. Just run
`make` to install the files.

# Compatibility

The scripts here should work on Linux. I have tested them mostly on
Debian-based systems. They will probably work on other distributions as well
but YMMV. If you find anything not working feel free to open up an issue to let
me know.
